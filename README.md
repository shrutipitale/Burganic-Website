**#BurganicWebsite**
This is my group's diploma Mini-Project. We built the burganic website in summer last year using html, CSS, and javascript.
Quick Food Management is a completely responsive website that allows you to add items to your cart, provide comments, log in and register, and check out.
Shruti Pitale, Mahima Rana, Snehnal Bavkar, and Godsee Almedia designed the project.
